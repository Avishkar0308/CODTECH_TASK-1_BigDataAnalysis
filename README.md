                        OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT  

Dataset Name: Mall_Customers.csv

Description: This dataset contains information about customers of a shopping mall, including attributes like:

CustomerID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1–100)

Purpose: To understand how demographic and financial factors influence customer spending patterns.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

PySpark → For scalable big data analysis

Google Colab → Cloud-based notebook environment

Pandas & Matplotlib → For small-sample visualization and plotting

GitHub → For code storage and submission

🔍 Process Overview

Data Loading: Load the large dataset into Spark DataFrame.

Data Exploration: Examine schema, count rows, and view summary statistics.

Data Processing: Perform filtering, grouping, and aggregation using Spark’s parallelized transformations.

Insight Generation: Analyze spending behavior based on gender, income, and other parameters.

Visualization: Plot income vs. spending score to understand customer segmentation visually.

Scalability Demonstration: Use Spark’s distributed computation to process and analyze data efficiently.

💡 Key Insights

Female customers tend to have slightly higher average spending scores.

Higher annual income often correlates with moderate-to-high spending scores.

PySpark enables quick computation even for large datasets, showing how big data tools improve analysis performance.

🏁 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how PySpark can be used for big data analysis.
By using parallel and distributed data processing, large-scale datasets can be handled more efficiently than traditional single-machine methods.
The project highlights practical applications of big data tools in customer analytics and decision-making.
